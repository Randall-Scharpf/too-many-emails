Hey y'all!

I know there are tools like jsonschema, which can also be integrated into VS
Code's IntelliSense, but considering the amount of time we have left, I figured
it would be less of a logistical nightmare to just use example JSON files to
show you what the real ones will look like as opposed to learning and imposing a
new set of tools.

The included schemas are .jsonc (JSON with comments) files so I could annotate
them with helpful comments. This technically makes it invalid JSON which would
require an external tool to properly parse, but that's fine because they're just
for documentation purposes and not meant to be loaded anyway.
