# too-many-emails

For when you have too many emails from too many emailers, make too many emails: fight back!

## Description

This application is an email client that lets users create and keep track of temporary/throwaway emails in one place.

Many websites require a user to input their email address in order to benefit from their services. This web application strives to limit a user’s primary inbox to personal and professional emails rather than spam and promotional content, while still allowing future access. With other temporary email services, the email is "killed" after an allotted time, typically 10 minutes, which makes it difficult to re-authenticate a user’s email on certain websites.

## Installation

TODO: Instructions on how to set up and run our application locally as mandated by the [spec](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall22/cs35L/project.html).

Some things we might need to consider and should not forget when the time comes to update this section:

- Compatible operating systems, browsers, Node.js versions, etc.
- Necessary environment variables, if any
- Shell commands to run (possibly for both Windows and Unix), including:
  - Cloning the repository or downloading and installing a distribution file
  - Installing Node.js dependencies
  - Running the application and viewing it in the browser
